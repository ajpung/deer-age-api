## Introduction

This repository contains scripts used to predict deer age via Machine Learning and Computer Vision. In the approach, two separate models are developed: one for age prediction via trail camera images, and a second using jawbone images. Each technique utilizes a different model.

In an effort to make all models fast, efficient, and streamlined, models are built to accept both grayscale and colored images  and utilize only a single optimized model (no ensembles). Augmentation further helps fmdecelop the model, applying a series of small changes to the base training set images.
